## Description<a name="description"></a>

Nowadays cars have been a necessity to a family. People buy a car, drive it for several years and sold it for a new one or  get it totaled eventually. Before the owner ready to sold a used car, a fair price is most important to both the seller and buyer.

For this project  I analyzed [`Used Car Auction Prices`](https://www.kaggle.com/tunguz/used-car-auction-prices) dataset with  559k rows and I intended to better understand:
1. When do people sell a car?
2. Should the valuation by specilists is a fair price?
3. How do we estimate the value of a car without valuations by specilists?
